This Arduino code establishes a program to oversee pressure values from analog sensors. The information is then showcased on a 4x20 I2C LCD screen, offering a clear representation of both target and current pressure. Additionally, the program integrates LEDs attached to specific pins, like 13, 12, 8, 4, and 7, functioning as visual indicators. These LEDs can be configured to represent pressure thresholds or signal specific events. In essence, the code develops a comprehensive system for monitoring pressure and conveying the information through an LCD screen, with the added benefit of visual feedback through LEDs for enhanced user understanding.

Rocket Launch Countdown Simulation:
This Arduino script emulates a countdown sequence for a rocket launch. It initiates the countdown, communicates messages to the serial monitor, and triggers a relay pin to mimic the ignition and liftoff of a rocket. Customization options are available to adapt the code for specific hardware requirements, allowing for the inclusion of additional logic as necessary. In essence, the code serves as a foundation for simulating a realistic countdown experience for a rocket launch using Arduino technology.
